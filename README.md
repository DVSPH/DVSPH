# DVSPH.NET

Basic PHP scripts for interacting with DVSPH.net APIs

The API JSON file gets requested every time the page is loaded.  You could reduce the load on your server by requesting the JSON file less frequently. Every 60 minutes or even once a day would be adequate as frequent changes aren't expected.

## Contributing
PR and additonal scripts are warmly welcomed

## iframe pages
For those that don't wish to use JSON (XML or CSV) already prepared iframe pages are available at [https://dvsph.net/api](https://dvsph.net/api).

Just copy and paste the following example into your page, adjust height and width to suit.

Example: <iframe src="https://dvsph.net/api/html/TalkGroups3.php" height="1000" width="100%" frameBorder="0" title="DVSPH_TalkGroups"></iframe>

## DMR Options Generator

Code inspired by Jim Nessen but uses non of Jim's code.
Full code will be available once it has been converted from the DVSPH custom version
