# DVSPH.NET

Basic PHP scripts for interacting with DVSPH.net APIs

The API JSON file gets requested every time the page is loaded.  You could reduce the load on your server by requesting the JSON file less frequently. Every 60 minutes or even once a day would be adequate as frequent changes aren't expected.
